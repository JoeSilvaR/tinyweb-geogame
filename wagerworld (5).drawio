And they get half of their coins. They can go into mining mode in a town and keep 100% of the coins. Each town has an elected mayor that is in charge of kicking people out. There is a complaint system, where anyone can submit a complaint about anyone and that is tied to the town. If someone has 3 complaints from unique people, they can be kicked out at the mayors discretion. Mayor can be put up for reelection if 10 complaints have been made. Mayor can upload C++ OpenGL games to the game center, where users can bet against each other, movies can be streamed from the mayors computer and viewed in the theatre, twitch style chat will be part of the theatre. Leaderboards for each game as well as swag will all be part of the game that can be created and purchased from other players, should have some mechanics around unique swag and limiting numbers of them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" style="text;html=1;whiteSpace=wrap;overflow=hidden;rounded=0;" parent="1" vertex="1">
